This notebook is a supplementary file for the submission of the Project in the Course MOEC0482: Big Data Methods for Economists at the University of Zurich.

We use a dataset on swiss real estate in order to predict a monthly renting price. The dataset is not uploaded to GitHub. We use 8 different prediction algorithms, of which XGB performs the best.
