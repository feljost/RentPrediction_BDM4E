# Rent Prediction Project - Big Data Methods for Economists (UZH)

This notebook is a supplementary file for the submission of the Project in the Course MOEC0482: Big Data Methods for Economists at the University of Zurich.

We use a dataset on swiss real estate in order to predict a monthly renting price. The dataset is not uploaded to GitHub. We use 8 different prediction algorithms, of which XGB performs the best.

If you want to run the Notebook, you will need to use the dataset provided in the course, as well as the gemeinden GEOJSON file provided in this repository (source: https://github.com/cividi/ch-municipalities)
