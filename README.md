We use a dataset on swiss real estate in order to predict a monthly renting price. We use 8 different prediction algorithms, of which XGB performs the best. The dataset is not uploaded to GitHub. 

If you want to run the Notebook, you will need to use the dataset provided in the course, as well as the gemeinden GEOJSON file provided in this repository (source: https://github.com/cividi/ch-municipalities)
